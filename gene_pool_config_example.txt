# Game time
#
# If the game time increment is positive, the time for each game
# starts at the minimum, then goes up by the increment after each
# round of games. When it reaches the maximum, the game time will
# remain at the maximum time until the end of the run. If the game
# time increment is negative, then the game time will start at the
# maximum game time and go down by the increment until it reaches the
# minimum game time, where it will remain thereafter.
