# Oscillating game time
#
# If "oscillating time" is "yes", the time for each game starts
# at the minimum, then goes up by the increment after each round
# of games. When it reaches the maximum, the increment is reversed
# and the time for each game goes down until it reaches the minimum.
# Then, the cycle starts again. If the "oscillating time" is "no",
# then the game time will stop and remain at the maximum time until
# the end of the run.
