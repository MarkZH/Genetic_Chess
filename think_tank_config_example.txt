# Oscillating game time

# The time for each game starts at the minimum, then goes up
# by the increment after each round of games. When it reaches
# the maximum, the increment is reversed and the time for each
# game goes down until it reaches the minimum. Then, the cycle
# starts again. If the "oscillating time" is "no", then the
# game time will stop and remain at the maximum time until the
# end of the run.
